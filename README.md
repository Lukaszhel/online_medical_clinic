# online_medical_clinic

Hi, this is a demo project of an application simulating the operation of a medical clinic on the Internet.
By logging in as a patient, you can choose a doctor with a specific specialization, 
check available appointments and register at a time convenient for you.
You can then view your visit history and from this level you can also delete your booking if your plans have changed.
By logging in as a doctor, you can add appointments by selecting dates and times in the calendar window. 
If you are going to work for several consecutive days in the same hours, you can select a wider range of dates. 
Then add the hours you will work and how long one visit should last. 
Visits according to this scheme will be created automatically.
You can browse published appointments for those that the patient has signed up for.
You can add a comment to your booked appointments.
The project is under development and new functionalities will be added.
